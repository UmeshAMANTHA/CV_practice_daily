# Image Formation and Geometric Transformations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `day.ipynb`, which demonstrates basic image processing tasks using Python, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. The main focus is on image formation and geometric transformations such as translation and rotation.

## Contents

- **day.ipynb**: The main notebook that walks through:
  - Importing required libraries (`cv2`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`)
  - Loading an image (`Labrador Dog.jpg`) using OpenCV
  - Displaying the image with Matplotlib (handling BGR to RGB conversion)
  - Performing geometric transformations (translation, rotation) on the image

- **Labrador Dog.jpg**: Sample image used in the notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure all requirements are installed (e.g., via `pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib`).
3. Open `day.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to see image loading, displaying, and transformation operations.

## Notes

- Make sure `Labrador Dog.jpg` is in the same directory as the notebook, or update the image path in the code cells accordingly.
- The notebook demonstrates how to handle image color formats between OpenCV and Matplotlib.
